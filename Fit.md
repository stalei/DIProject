(Surge vs Reopening Growth Factor)

In the next step we can fit a function on this data and predict the surge rate as a function of the growth factor at the time of reopening. 
This function could help us predict the increase for a new state given their growth factor. And finally this code will ask for a growth factor 
and will provide the increase two weeks after reopening.
 Reopening time are taken from NYTimes reoprt:
