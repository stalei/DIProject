As a scientist I was thrilled by solving problems especially problems with a real life implication. The latest pandemic has had a dvastating effects on societies and data analysis of the pandemic has been challenging and extremely important to stop the spread and recover after we move out of pandemic. We still don't have a complete picture of this phenomena so we can study the data and extract the correlations. I start this project with a code to scrape daily reports by John Hopkins university. Then add them together and plot the general trend for a given list of states.
In the next step I extract the growth factor(GF). GF is defined as the chage today devided by the change yesterday. In theory ih this number is above one we will see increase and if this number is below one we are moving to contain the spread and stop it so 1 is inflection point. 
Using this number we can study the pattern and in a long time we can perform a time series analysis. For example one simple problem would be studing the surge based on the growth factor at reopening.
